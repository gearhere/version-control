# Version Control System Getting started

Notes based on Udacity's Git and GitHub course.

Complete all exercises on windows 10.

## Content

1. Record key points of the course;

2. Supplement what the course lacks, like how to configure the Git when using a text editor other than Sublime;

3. Record questions and concerning thoughts;

4. As the course is taught in English and instructors speak fast, I incidentally practice my listening and take notes of native expressions, which are deleted after getting notes together.
